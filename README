swedish_pluralize
=========
 
Swedish pluralize inflections taken from swe_rails plugin by Ola Bini. The plugin is downsized to fit our needs at Newsdesk, so it's possible the swe_rails plugin will suit your needs better. Look for it on GitHub. This is for pluralization only.

It adds an string inflector: String#swedish_pluralize.

Installation
=========

Grab the plugin:
 
./script/plugin install git://github.com/newsdesk/swedish_pluralize.git
